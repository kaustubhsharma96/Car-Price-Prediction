# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning


A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?
How well those variables describe the price of a car?

## Summary

For my project, "Modeling Car Prices," I set out to create a reliable model for anticipating car pricing based on a variety of vehicle parameters by using data-driven research. My methodical investigation and analysis produced insightful findings and a predictive model that has the potential to greatly help the automobile sector.

#### Key Steps and Findings:
    1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
        * I started by loading and looking through a large dataset that included details on the features and cost of cars.
        * The procedures involved in preprocessing the data were determining the Fuel Economy metric, managing missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

    2. Feature Selection
        * I discovered a number of major predictor variables that are crucial in influencing the cost of cars. Car length, car width, curb weight, engine size, horsepower, 
          and other characteristics were among them.

    3. Models
        * Linear Regression
        * Ridge
        * Lasso
        * SDG Regressor

    4. Model Evaluation
        * MSE -mean squared error
        * R^2 score


## Impact

With the help of my project, automakers, dealers, and customers will have access to a potent instrument for precise pricing estimation. These insights improve competitiveness, pricing strategies, and decision-making in the dynamic automobile business. My research uses extensive data analysis and machine learning approaches to help consumers make more educated decisions when buying cars.
